Figure out TypeScript stuff
- Favor props are a bit weird still
- FavorType enum is also weird (but works)
- Move everything to global types

Fix styling
- FavorList is mostly acceptable for now
- TypeSelector is eh ok
- Header is also pretty good
- Need to figure out font
- Ideally, have main header scroll past and type selector stay sticky at the top

Integrate backend
- Get favor list
- Get user info

Things not yet implemented
- Favor detailed view
- Navigation
